# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive pricing component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8).
Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

```css
/* it seems silly but this is the first time  i discover that if i want the image to appear first 
 i have to put it first in the background property*/

body {
  background:
    url("images/pattern-circles.svg") no-repeat,
    url("images/bg-pattern.svg") no-repeat;
}
```
